## 7-Section Format — Structural Steps <a id="7-section"></a>

Use for steps where the AI executes structural operations with minimal judgment calls. The step receives input, transforms or stores it, and passes output to the next step.

```
=== PROJECT SPECIFICATION ===
Project: [Project Name] — Step N: [Step Name]
Date: [date]
Status: Draft — review before execution

---

## 1. Overview

2-3 sentences: what this step does and why it matters.
One sentence: what it explicitly does NOT do (scope boundary).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

Numbered list of verifiable conditions.
Each criterion checkable by an independent observer.
No vague criteria ("high quality"). Only observable outcomes.

## 3. Constraint Architecture

### Must Do
Non-negotiable requirements. Each tied to a reason.

### Must Not Do
Explicit prohibitions. Each with a one-line failure mode explanation:
- Must not [action].
  Prevents: [specific failure scenario]

### Prefer
Judgment guidance when multiple approaches are valid.

### Escalate (Do Not Decide — Surface to [Owner])
Technology/architecture decisions for engineering.
Mark each: [OPEN — Engineering] or [OPEN — PM + Engineering]

## 4. Task Decomposition

Sub-tasks, each with:
- Input / Output / Acceptance Criteria / Dependencies / Scope
Technology scope questions: [OPEN — Engineering]

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

How to assess whether the step is working correctly in production.
Specific and measurable where possible.

## 6. Context and Reference

Background the executor needs.
Why specific decisions were made (the "why" that prevents
"smart but wrong" execution).
Constraints from external factors (compliance, channel behavior, etc.)

## 7. Definition of Done

Exactly three conditions that must all be true.
"Step is complete when ALL of the following are true..."
```

## 14-Section Format — Judgment Steps <a id="14-section"></a>

Use for steps where the AI exercises judgment: classification, delegation, routing, escalation, communication decisions. This format uses all three prompts.

```
=== PROJECT SPECIFICATION ===
Project: [Project Name] — Step N: [Step Name]
Date: [date]
Status: Draft — review before execution

Note: This spec applies Prompt 1 (Specification Engineer) +
Prompt 2 (Intent & Delegation Framework Builder) +
Prompt 3 (Constraint Architecture Designer).
Constraints are derived from failure modes, not from speculative guardrails.

---

## 1. Overview
What this step does, why it matters, scope boundary.

## 2. Core Intent (Prompt 2)
What the system optimizes for that a reasonable alternative would not.
What the decision-maker's version of "step failed" looks like.

## 3. Priority Hierarchy (Prompt 2)
Ordered conflict resolution. When these values conflict, resolve
in this order: [1] ... [2] ... etc.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Prompt 1)
Independently verifiable conditions. Same rules as 7-section format.

## 5. Constraint Architecture (Prompt 3 — failure-mode-driven)

### Failure Mode [Name]: [description]
[Constraints derived from this specific failure mode]

Must Do
Must Not Do (each tied to a specific failure mode)
Prefer
Escalate [OPEN — Engineering] or [OPEN — PM + Engineering]

## 6. Decision Authority Map (Prompt 2)
### Decide Autonomously
### Decide with Notification (flag and proceed)
### Escalate Before Acting (do not act without human)

## 7. Quality Thresholds (Prompt 2)
Routine vs. high-stakes definition for this step.
The explicit line between them.

## 8. Common Failure Modes (Prompt 2 + Prompt 3)
Numbered failures with: what happened, root cause, correct approach.

## 9. Special Handling Rules (Prompt 2)
Exceptions to normal rules. Specific situations that need
different behavior.

## 10. Klarna Test (Prompt 2)
Self-check before finalizing. "Am I optimizing for the
label/rule, or for the action it triggers?"
Specific check questions for this step.

## 11. Task Decomposition (Prompt 1)
Same sub-task format as 7-section. Input/Output/Acceptance/
Dependencies/Scope.

## 12. Evaluation Criteria (Prompt 1)
How to know this step is working in production.

## 13. Context and Reference (Prompt 1)
The WHY behind key decisions. Same as section 6 in 7-section format.

## 14. Definition of Done (Prompt 1)
Conditions that must all be true. Same rigor as 7-section format.
```

## NLSpec Writing Rules <a id="nlspec"></a>

Every behavioral statement in the spec must have three components:

```
WHAT:  The system must do X
WHEN:  Under condition Y
WHY:   Because Z
```

The "why" is the most important part. When an agent encounters an edge case the spec didn't anticipate, the "why" allows it to make the correct decision.

**Bad:** "The system must validate the patient record."

**Good:** "WHAT: The system must verify that a record exists for the identified entity before proceeding to task creation. WHEN: After entity resolution succeeds (Step 3). WHY: Downstream steps (scheduling, task routing, assignment) all require a canonical record. Proceeding without one causes silent failures that are impossible to trace post-hoc."

### The New-Hire Test

A spec is complete when a capable new hire with no context could implement it with at most one clarifying question. If you would need to explain something verbally, that explanation belongs in the spec.

### Constraint Writing Rules

A constraint is a measurable invariant, not a policy statement.

| Not a constraint | A constraint |
|---|---|
| "The system must be fast." | "P99 latency must not exceed 800ms under 100 concurrent requests." |
| "Handle errors gracefully." | "On 5xx: retry with exponential backoff, base 2s, max 30s, max 3 attempts. Surface structured error." |
| "Protect user data." | "PII fields must not appear in application logs at any level. Audit entries must include user_id, action, timestamp, resource_id." |

If a constraint cannot be automatically verified, rewrite it until it can.

### [OPEN] Item Markers

In **split mode** (PM + Engineering separate):
- `[OPEN — Engineering]` for technology decisions PM cannot make
- `[OPEN — PM + Engineering]` for joint decisions requiring both sides
- `[OPEN — PM]` for product decisions not yet finalized

In **solo mode** (one person does both):
- `[OPEN]` for any decision not yet made, with a note on what's needed to resolve it
