## How Skills Work

Each skill is a folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file and optional `references/` directories. Claude Code reads the `SKILL.md` when invoked and loads reference files as needed.

Skills installed to `~/.claude/skills/` are globally available in every project.

Some skills are "plugins" with richer structure (commands/, agents/, hooks/). These provide slash commands, sub-agents, and automated hooks beyond the core skill.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the AllCare team and the community.

**Adding a new skill:**

1. Create a folder under `skills/` with your skill name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `category`) and the skill instructions
3. Optionally add a `references/` directory for supporting files
4. Update `install.sh` if the skill needs hooks or special setup
5. Open a PR with a clear description of what the skill does and when to use it

**Improving an existing skill:**

- Fix unclear instructions, add missing edge cases, improve question flows
- Test by copying the updated `SKILL.md` to `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` and running it

**Guidelines:**

- Skills should be self-contained. No external dependencies beyond Claude Code.
- Write instructions as if the reader has never seen the skill before.
- Include concrete examples where possible.
- Keep the scope focused. One skill, one job.
